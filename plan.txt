## Project ##

You are required to write an Android app which will allow the
user to maintain a task list. The user should be able to enter
tasks and display them in a list. The list should only show
the bare details of each task. Selecting a task from the list
should bring up another screen which shows full details of the
task. Users should also be able to mark tasks as completed.

  - Use the calendar to set due dates on tasks.
